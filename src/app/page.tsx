I&apos;m a graduate candidate at the University of Kentucky&apos;s College of Communication and Information Science. 
My interests are in small group and team communication and organizational communication. 
I&apos;m originally from Corydon, Iowa (90 minutes south of Des Moines), where I grew up on a farm. 
In addition to scholarship, I enjoy reading fantasy and historical fiction, running, and attending cycling classes.

<h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Research</h2>
My research interests are in small group and team communication and organizational communication. 
Taking a functional approach, I am interested in how groups and organizations achieve their goals. 
Specifically, I examine how people understand, organize, and use information and manage messages when engaging in task and relational focused processes. 
My research is typically quantitative in nature, using surveys to address hypotheses and research question. However, I also have been trained in qualitative methods and use these techniques when appropriate.

<h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Teaching</h2>
My teaching philosophy can be summed up as being both reciprocal and communal. 
Teachers should walk alongside their students, helping them understand and apply content to real-world situations. Interaction with students should serve as a source of inspiration, helping teachers learn new ways of teaching information, identify new avenues for research, and expand ideas beyond their own field of experience.
Together, teachers and students may build their own individual skills, enabling them to achieve personal goals while also strengthening their learning community.
