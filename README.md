Welcome!

I'm a graduate candidate at the University of Kentucky's College of Communication and Information Science. 
My interests are in small group and team communication and organizational communication. 
I'm originally from Corydon, Iowa (90 minutes south of Des Moines), where I grew up on a farm. 
In addition to scholarship, I enjoy reading fantasy and historical fiction, running, and attending cycling classes.
